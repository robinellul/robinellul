<h1>Apollo</h1>
<h2>God of Archery, Music and Divination</h2>
<p>Apollo was the epitome of youth and beauty, a source of life and healing, a patron of the arts and as bright and powerful as the sun itself. Apollo was perhaps the most loved of all the gods, worshipped in Delphi and Delos, and others. Son of Zeus and Leto, the twin brother of Artemis, Apollo was born on the island of Delos. Due to Hera’s jealousy and his father’s infidelity, Leto had chosen Delos as the safest place she could find. It’s said that at the first taste of ambrosia, he transformed from a baby to a man. He was then given his bow, crafted by Hephaestus, the master craftsman of Mount Olympus.
 </p>
<p>Much like the other gods, Apollo had many children. The most well known are: Orpheus, a master of the lyre; Asclepius, who was given the knowledge of healing and medicine; and the hero Ion.
