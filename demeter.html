<h1>Demeter</h1>
<h2>Goddess of Harvest, Agriculture, Fertility and Sacred Law</h2>
<p>Demeter was one of the oldest gods in the Greek pantheon, believed to be a reincarnation of the mother earth goddesses worshipped in Bronze Age Greece. Demeter guaranteed the fertility of the earth and protected farming and vegetation. It’s said that her close connection with the earth was inherited from Demeter’s mother, Rhea.
</p>
<p>Born the same way as Hera and the other siblings, Demeter was also rescued by Zeus from their father. Demeter had two kids with Zeus, Persephone and Iacchus. She also had a child with the mortal Cretan Iasion, Plutus the god of wealth. She also adopted the Eleusinian prince, Demophon, whom she shared her agriculture secrets with. Demeter was also chased by Poseidon, Demeter tried to escape by turning into a mare. However, Poseidon also turned into a horse. Their offspring was Arion, the pegasus ridden by Heracles.
