<h1>Zeus</h1>
<h2>God of the Sky, Lightning and Thunder</h2>
<p>Zeus was born from the Titan Cronus, and Cronus’s sister, Rhea. He’s brothers with Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades and Poseidon. Cronus was paranoid, as his parents had prophesied that his children would turn against him. To keep that from happening, Cronus ate his children. Zeus, youngest out of all his siblings, was saved by Rhea, who didn’t want another child of hers to be swallowed. Cronus swallowed a special stone wrapped in blankets, while Zeus was entrusted to her nymphs. After training, Zeus was given a mixture to give to Cronus. Cronus, after drinking the mixture, vomited his children, one by one. Together with his siblings, he defeated Cronus and the other titans. Locking them away in Tartarus.</p>
<p>Zeus was the king of the 12 Olympians and the greatest god in Greek Religion. Zeus gave out justice, holding out order between the gods and humanity. </p>
<p>
Though he was married (first to Titan Metis, then to Hera), Zeus is infamous for his many affairs. He often transformed himself into various animals and other humans to get his prey. Therefore, he fathered many children.
