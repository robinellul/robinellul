<h1>Poseidon</h1>
<h2>God of the Sea, Earthquakes, and Horses</h2>
<p>Poseidon was known to be one of the most disruptive of the ancient gods, but he wasn’t always seen in a negative light. He was a protector to mariners and a tamer of horses. His cults date as far back as the Bronze age and Mycenaean civilization, peaking between the 15th and 12th century BCE. He was the most important god in Mycenaean civilizations, primarily known for causing earthquakes. </p>
<p>In later mythology, he was the son of Cronus and Rhea, and the brother of Zeus, Hera, Hades, Demeter and Hestia. When they defeated Cronus, Poseidon split the world between the three brothers, where he ended up ruling over the seas. However, seemingly not content with only the seas, Poseidon often interrupted Zeus’s plans, and even once attempted to overthrow his brother, with the help of Hera and Athena. As a punishment, Poseidon was sent to build the walls of Troy.
 </p>
<p>
Much like his brother, Zeus, Poseidon had a lot of children. He slept with Athena's priestess as revenge for losing Athen's favour. When Athena found out, she transformed her priestess into a horrible monster with snakes for hair, known as Medusa. The monster was then sent to an island far from Olympus.
