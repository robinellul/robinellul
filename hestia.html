<h1>Hestia</h1>
<h2>Goddess of Hearth, Home and Hospitality </h2>
<p>Hestia was the oldest out of their siblings. When the gods Apollo and Poseidon asked for her hand in marriage, Hestia decided that she’d remain a virgin forever. Zeus approved and bestowed her the honour of presiding over all sacrifices. </p>
<p>She was worshipped mainly as the virgin goddess of the hearth. She also had a public cult at the civic hearth in the town hall. Hestia was closely connected with Zeus, god of the family in its external relation of hospitality and its internal unity. She was also associated with Hermes, her nephew; the two represented domestic life on one side and business and outdoor life on the other. 
 </p>
<p>
Some sources place Hestia as the 12th Olympian, while others say it was Dionysus instead. It’s told, due to this, that Hestia gave up her place in Mount Olympus to Dionysus.
