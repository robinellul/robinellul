<h1>Hephaestus</h1>
<h2>God of Fire and Metallurgy</h2>
<p>Hephaestus was the brilliant blacksmith of the Olympian Gods, with his workshop beneath volcanoes. Hephaestus had a lame foot, causing him to be known as the less than perfect god. His origins are still rather obscure, but it’s believed that he was born from Hera, without a father, out of jealousy of Zeus birthing Athena. Due to his disability, it was said that either Hera or Zeus threw him off of Olympus, landing in the island of Lemnos. He was cared for by Thetis and Eurynome. He would build his workshop in the island’s volcano.
 </p>
<p>Once Hephaestus made his way back to Olympus, he captured his mother, Hera, taking revenge for her throwing him out of Olympus. In exchange for Hera getting released, she promised Aphrodite’s hand in marriage. However, Aphrodite had many affairs, ending the marriage quickly. Hephaestus caught them during the act and called upon Olympus to witness them. 
 </p>
<p>

	<ul>
		<li>The sceptre and aegis of Zeus</li>
