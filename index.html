<h1>Greek Mythology - The basics!</h1>
			<h2>Historical Context</h2>
					<p> Ancient Greece was thriving around 700 BC. Before that, the civilization in the area was Mycenaean Greece, which existed between 1600-1100 BC. After Mycenaean Greece collapsed, there were a few centuries of dark ages where nothing really got written down. Mycenaean Greece and Ancient Greece had a pretty interesting dynamic, despite being different cultures practically speaking, Ancient Greece thought themselves as the successor to Mycenaean Greece. Classic myths and stories like The Iliad and The Odyssey were written in the 700s BC but were actually set in Mycenaean Greece. Mycenaean language is considered an early form of Greek, but was written in Linear B, a script replaced around 900 BC by the basically modern Greek Alphabet. 
</p>
					<p>This is important because the majority of the pantheon originated in Mycenaean Greece, this was discovered because archeologists found their names written in Linear B inscriptions. </p>

				<h2> The Trojan War </h2>
				<p> Many already have some knowledge of the Trojan War, such as the wooden horse disguised as an offering and the death of Achilles. The conflict between the Greeks and the people of Troy, sparked the imagination of the Greeks more than any previous event. Itâ€™s told in the Iliad and the Odyssey of Homer, as well as other works lost to time. The war had many domino effects that lead to it sparking, but the main ones are Helen's marriage and a quarrel between three goddesses. </p>
				
				<p> With Helen being the most beautiful woman in the world and quite the desirable bride, her father had a hard time choosing who to marry her to, afraid that his answer would spark conflict between the other kings. Odysseus, a hero from the very well known story of the odyssey, offers the king his help in exchange for recommending Odysseus to marry the Spartan King Icarius's daughter, Penelope. Tyndareus, Helen's father, agreed and Odysseus suggested that he make all the suitors swear a binding oath to protect the winner's marriage against any kind of interference, so no war would spark out with his decision. </p>
				<p> After the suitors agree to the oath, Tyndareus ends up choosing Menelaus for Helen. THe rest of the suitors pack up and go home after this decision, which ends with Odysseus and Penelope getting together. 
				</p>
				
				<p> Eris had a price, a golden apple, given to the most beautiful goddess. Hermes, sent by Zeus to de-escalate the situation, decided that Paris would be the one to choose, son of the Trojan king. The contestants were Hera, Athena and Aphrodite. Each offered Paris a bribe for choosing them: Hera promised to make him king of the world, Athena offered him glory and victory in battle, and Aphrodite promised him Helen as his wife. </p>
				
				<p> Helen was considered the most beautiful woman in the world, therefore, Aphrodite's offer was the one that Paris chose. That's how Helen became Helen of Troy as she now belogned to Troy, abducted by Aphrodite and Paris. However, not only did that anger the other two goddesses, but a lot of Greek kings as well as Helen was already married at this point. Due to the binding oath that her suitors had agreed to, they had to step in. </p>
				
				<p> Achilles plays a big part during the war, despite not being bound by the oath. It was prophesied that if Achilles went to war in Troy, he'd live a short life but will be remembered forever; If he didn't go to war, he would life a long life but die in obscurity. Given those two options, he decided to go down in history. Unfortunately, Achilles's death is very vague and incosistent but the more mentioned way is being shot by Paris with Apollo's help. </p>
		<br>
<p>After a decade of fighting, the Achaeans finally come up with a way to end the war. This is where the wooden horse comes in. The Achaeans burn their camp and 'retreat', leaving behind a large wooden horse, built with help from Athena. In the camp, the trojans find a guy named Sinon, who spins a story about being left as a sacrifice to allow the rest of the Achaeans to sail home. He explains that the horse was built to bring back Athena's favour after Odysseus and Diomedes angered her by stealing her sacred statue. The horse, according to Sinon, was precious to Athena and those who damage it will be cursed. Thhe Trojans, buying it, brought the horse inside their walls.</p>
				<p> That same night, Sinon sneaks away and opens the trapdoor leading to the inside of the horse, where many soldiers come out and raid Troy, burning it to the ground.</p>
				<p>That's how the decade long war of Troy finally ends and Helen is safely rescued and brought back to her husband.</p>
