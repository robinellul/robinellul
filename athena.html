<h1>Athena</h1>
<h2>Goddess of Wisdom and Military Victory</h2>
<p>Her birth was known to be a little controversial, but it's best known that she was born fully armed from Zeus’ forehead, after Zeus swallowed her pregnant mother, Metis. She took part in helping a lot of heroes, such as Hercules, Odysseus and even Perseus. She was believed to be Zeus’ favourite daughter; The wisest, most courageous and the most resourceful out of the Olympian gods.</p>
<p>Athena is closely associated with Athens, the city named in her honour. The people of Attica chose her as their patron, thanking her for her gift of the olive tree. Her adopted son Erichthonios was one of the first kings of Athens. In her role as protector, she was also worshipped in many other cities, being the patron of Sparta, the founder of Thebes in Boeotia and at Corinth, where she appeared on the city’s coins.
