<h1>Hermes</h1>
<h2>God of Trade, Wealth, Luck, Fertility, Animal Husbandry, Sleep, Language, Thieves and Travel</h2>
<p>He’s believed to be the son of Zeus and Maia, a nymph and daughter of Titan Atlas. He was known to be the messenger of the gods, and one of the most mischievous of the olympians. He was also the one to guide souls to the underworld. Even from when he was merely a baby, he was known for his impish behaviour and curiosity. He had invented the lyre, the alphabet and the dice. He was the patron of shepherds and invented the panpipes they used to call their flock.</p>
<p>When he was just a baby, he had already stolen his half-brother’s Apollo’s herd of 50 sacred cattle. Hermes was then associated with thieves. He managed to keep the cattle until the satyrs finally found them in a cave. He was allowed to keep the herd if he gave Apollo his lyre, made from the shell of a turtle. This was his first instance of stealing, in some other instances, he’s stolen Poseidon’s trident, Artemis’ arrows and Aphrodite’s Girdle.</p>
<p>
Hermes was involved in many episodes. On the orders of Zeus in order to free Io, Hermes had killed the 100-eyed monster Argos. He also freed Ares from his imprisonment inside a cauldron, by the twin Giants Otus and Ephialtes.
