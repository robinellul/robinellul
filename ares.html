<h1>Ares</h1>
<h2>God of War</h2>
<p>Son of Zeus and Hera, Ares was in love with Aphrodite. He was known to be one of the most unpopular gods, due to his short temper, and thirst for conflict. He was most famously known for seducing Aphrodite, unsuccessfully fought Heracles and killed Poseidon’s son Helirrhothios. Ares was even more popular in Roman times, when he went by the name of Mars.  </p>
<p>Ares had various children with different partners, several faced Heracles when he performed his 12 labours. Ares’ daughter Hippolyta, the Amazon queen had lost her girdle to Hercules; his son Eurytion lost his cattle; and Diomedes had his horses stolen by the hero. The brave Amazonian were thought to be descendants of Ares.  He was able to use his beauty and courage to win the affections of Aphrodite. He had several children with her, such as Eros, the god of desire and love.
