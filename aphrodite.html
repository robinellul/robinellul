<h1>Aphrodite</h1>
<h2>Goddess of Love, Beauty, Desire and all aspects of Sexuality</h2>
<p>Aphrodite’s origin is conflicted. Hesiod (a legendary early Greek Epic poet) recounts that Aphrodite was born when Cronos castrated Uranus with a sickle. Cronos threw the genitalia into the sea, where Aphrodite sprouted from the resulting foam. However, Homer (another legendary Greek poet) claims that Aphrodite was the daughter of Zeus and Dione, the Titaness. Greeks were left in confusion due to this contradiction, Plato came up with a solution to end the controversy. He suggested that both stories were correct, and that they were two different goddesses of the same name.
</p>
<p>Aphrodite was assigned to marry Hephaestus by Hera, but not entranced with the lame god of fire and crafts, she wasn’t faithful to him. Aphrodite had notorious affairs with the gods Ares, Hermes, and Dionysus. Due to Ares being quite a cold god, this was the most shocking of flings. Hephaestus designed a trap to catch them in the act. The sun god, Helios, casted light upon the couple, so that all Olympians could get a good look at them. Humiliated, Ares fled to Thrace and Aphrodite to Cyprus.
